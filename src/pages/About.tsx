                This Heritage Repository is an ethical, consent-based digital archive dedicated to preserving and sharing indigenous cultural heritage, beginning with the Naga community.
              </p>
              <p>
                It bridges tradition and technology through community-led documentation of folktales, folksongs, folk dances, ritual practices, and material culture using tools like 3D scanning, drone imaging, and high-resolution recording.
              </p>
              <p>
                Culture is stored and shared only with explicit consent from its knowledge holders, maintaining authenticity and ownership. Each entry undergoes cultural verification by elders and scholars and may be classified as public, restricted, or confidential to protect sacred knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Viewers are encouraged to approach with awareness and cultural sensitivity. If any practices feel too personal or sacred, they may skip or exit; otherwise, they may proceed with respect for the deep ancestral and communal significance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Guided by ethical consent, cultural accuracy, and community governance, this repository empowers communities to manage and control their heritage in the digital spaceâ€”supporting continuity, not erasure.
